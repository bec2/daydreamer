Instructions: Locate the daydreamer.exe in the src folder and run it, or if you want to launch from python itself, run gui.py.<br><br>
Note: Self-care techniques should not replace medical intervention or counselling where necessary. They are meant to be a supplement to support healthy thinking and an active mind/body. Not all of them are possible for everyone, and that's normal and okay.<br><br>
Reciever of second place for the supporting mental health challenge at HackTheMidlands 2020! Thanks to everyone who supported.
